## What is Markdown Syntax?

Markdown syntax is markup language that uses a plain text format. It is easily converted into other text types such as HTML as it has no hidden characters, unlike other text programs such as Word.

A variety of different symbols can be used in the Markdown syntax, such as (#) which can be used to create headers, as seen above. The more of the symbol in sequence, the smaller the header will be.


## What can git be used for?

Git is an online program that can be used to create repositorys to store files and documents in. 

It can be easily accessed and interacted with using the Linux command console, using certain commands to log into your account and to push / pull changes to documents you have stored within repositorys there.



#Practical session 2 & 3 
In this practical session we are beginning to create out basic motor. We are using a cork as the foundation of the motor, with copper wiring going around it for the coils. There is also a nail in either end to support the motor, and ensure it stays in its brackets. The brackets themselves are made out of large paperclips, as well as the brackets holding the magnets. I also used copper tape on the end of one side of the cork as a commutator, with a frayed multi core wire working as the brush to supply voltage. In total we had 116 coils around the motor, with 2 cores.

Overall the motor did not work very well, this was largely due to there only being two coils. THis meant that there were large gaps between the coils, resulting in the motor struggling to keep its momentum going. As well as this the motor could not really start by itself, it needed something external, such as me starting the turning motion by hand.

To improve my motor i am planning to completely redesign it using Solidworks. The designs for each piece can be seen below. I am going to have a bracket on either side of the motor to hold it up, as well as an upside down U shape bracket for the magnets. The magnets will be split into four to have two pulling and two pushing, instead of just having one pulling and one pushing.

As well as this i plan on increasing the amount of cores on the motor itself from 2 cores up to 8. The motor itself will be solid wood as well, with indents cut into it to ensure the coils stay in place. This was a slight issue on the old design as the coils were very spread, with some almost coming off the sides of the motor.

#Practical 4
In this practical we refined our solidworks designs, and created an area on the motor for the encoder.
