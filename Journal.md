## What is Markdown Syntax?

Markdown syntax is markup language that uses a plain text format. It is easily converted into other text types such as HTML as it has no hidden characters, unlike other text programs such as Word.

A variety of different symbols can be used in the Markdown syntax, such as (#) which can be used to create headers, as seen above. The more of the symbol in sequence, the smaller the header will be.


## What can git be used for?

Git is an online program that can be used to create repositorys to store files and documents in. 

It can be easily accessed and interacted with using the Linux command console, using certain commands to log into your account and to push / pull changes to documents you have stored within repositorys there.
